LIBestimote

The Innovative Library
=====================

By using the Estimote Beacon technology and Android Studio, we (Nathan Jiang, Saswata Gupta, Alicia Yu and I) created the LIBestimote at HackWestern 2. 

By integrating the beacons into libraries, we can better allow the users of the libraries to access and navigate the libraries with ease and convenience.
